    "Transformer-based language models like [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805v2) have revolutionized NLP in the past 5 years. One important point is that these models are capable of *transfer learning*, i.e. they undergo a (self-supervised) pretraining on a large text corpus and can later *fine-tuned* with a rather small dataset of annotated training data.\n",
